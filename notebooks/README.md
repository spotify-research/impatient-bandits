# Instructions

Run the notebook `generate-synthetic-data.ipynb` first, to generate a synthetic
dataset that enables running the other notebooks. Then:

- run `fig-stickiness-eval.ipynb` to generate Figures 3, 4 & 8,
- `fig-bandit-eval.ipynb` to generate Figures 5 & 6, and
- `fig-bandit-nonstationary.ipynb` to generate Figure 7

in the paper, respectively. Note: the results obtained using the synthetic data
differ from the ones reported in the paper, but they are qualitatively similar
and capture the main insights of our approach.
